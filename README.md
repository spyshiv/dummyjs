# How To use dummyjs

Import dummyjs inside your html file
    
     <script src="path/to/dummy.js" ></script>

There are three ways to use dummyjs:
    
    1. Generating dummy words
    
    2. Generating dummy Sentences
    
    3. Generating dummy paragraphs 
    
    
## 1. Generating Dummy Words
  To generate dummy words, add a new attribute to your HTML code with the format "data-dummy" followed by a numeric value and the letter "w" for "word". For example:
    
    <div data-dummy="4w"> </div>
    
This will generate four dummy words inside the div tag.

## 2. Generating Dummy Sentences
  To generate dummy sentences, use the "data-dummy" attribute with a numeric value followed by the letter "s" for "sentence". For example:
    
    <div data-dummy="4s"> </div>
    
This will generate four dummy sentences inside the div tag.
    
    
## 3. Generating Dummy Paragraphs
  To generate dummy paragraphs, use the "data-dummy" attribute with a numeric value followed by the letter "p" for "paragraph". For example:
    
    <div data-dummy="4p"> </div>
    
This will generate four dummy paragraphs inside the div tag.
